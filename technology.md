# Final_Project

# Technologies Used

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Jupyter Notebook and the Pandas library will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
Postgres is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Flask to display the data.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a linear regression. We'll train our algorithm with a histocal dataset on Covid Vaccinations and GDP of all countries. 

## Dashboard
In addition to using a Flask template, we will also integrate JavaScript, HTML, and CSS with the Plotly visualization library to build an interactive webpage. 

Possibly including the D3 library to visualize our data geographically.
