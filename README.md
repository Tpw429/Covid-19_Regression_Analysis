# Final Project Overview

Covid-19 is a global pandemic which has rocked our society to its core. It has caused massive fatality, increased unemployment across the nation, and shutdown travel in many parts of the world. We have decided that as a team we will be analyzing Covid-19 data because of its relevance in everyday life around us. Over the next few weeks, our team will be focused on recognizing and analyzing trends due to covid-19. The team members of this project include: Akshaya Kamble, Ray Hunt, Thomas Watson, and Tyler Engalla. Throughout the project we will be collaborting and working with one another to divide and conquer the full affects of this pandemic.

During this catastrope, we saw new daily confirmed patients into hospitals soaring as high as 18,000 new patients per day. Shortly after Covid-19 vaccinations became public, we began to see the number of covid confirmed patients fall significantly. The figure below shows the trend described.

In the figure above, we see that the newly confirmed Covid-19 patients tend to slowly increase with time up until January of 2021. In Feburary of 2021, we see a remarkable change in the shift of newly confirmed covid-19 patients per day. The case count begins to decrease rapdily with time, up until a support line is reached. This support line is very difficult to go below, because of factors such as available vaccinations, limited medical and economical resources available, and social distancing regulations changing. Although this is not a value we tabulated, it is important because it helps us understand the general health outline for Covid-19 during the past few months.

## Task Delegation
In the first week of the project, we had to make decisions on which members would be responsible for certain parts of the projects. As this was a group effort, many of often worked together to come to these conclusions. For week one, the following members were given these roles:

1) Square Role - Thomas Watson

This member is in charge of setting up the repository for the team to use. In addition, this member will ensure that each of the four members has their our branch to test and push changes to the main branch.

2) Triangle Role - Akshaya Kamble 

This team member will be responsible for creating a machine learning model. We will consider which model to choose, how to train the model, the accuracy of the model, and how it works.

3) Circle Role - Ray Hunt

This team member will be in charge of the mockup database. We will be creating an SQL-database, including an ERD of the database and a document showing how it is intergated in the database and its conection with the code.

4) X Role - Tyler Engalla

This team member will focus on the technology side of the project. They will consider the best tools to use for the project, what will be used in each section, and how each of these functions will flow together smoothly to provide a crisp result.

## The Plan Ahead

In our project, we will be analyzing details such as the type of stock thriving and dying because of the virus, what factors affect the case count, and predicting if cases will rise or fall in the near future.
