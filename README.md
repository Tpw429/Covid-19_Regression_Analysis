## Segment 1 - Triangle role

For the final project we have selected Supervised Machine learning and we will use Linear Regression Model as this will help us to analyze data of the Covid Vaccinations and GDP of all countries. This model will help predict distributions of the vaccines in each country.
As we have continuous data we will identify the relation between data and make predictions.
