# Final_Project

Covid-19 is a global pandemic which has rocked our society to its core. It has caused massive fatality, increased unemployment across the nation, and shutdown travel in many parts of the world. Over the next few weeks, our team will be focused on recognizing and analyzing trends due to covid-19. The team members of this project include: Akshaya Kamble, Ray Hunt, Thomas Watson, and Tyler Engalla. Throughout the project we will be collaborting and working with one another to divide and conquer the full affects of this pandemic.

During this catastrope, we saw new daily confirmed patients growing as high as 18,000 new cases per day. Shortly after Covid-19 vaccinations became public, we began to see new daily cases fall significantly. The figure below shows the trend described.

In the figure above, we see that the newly confirmed Covid-19 cases tend to slowly increase with time up until January of 2021. In Feburary of 2021, we see a remarkable change in the shift of newly confirmed covid-19 cases per day. The case count begins to decrease rapdily with time, up until a support line is reached. This support line is very difficult to go below, because of factors such as available vaccinations, limited medical and economical resources available, and social distancing regulations changing.
